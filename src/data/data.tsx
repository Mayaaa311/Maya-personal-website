          Worked on an end-to-end collaborative machine learning project that predicted the success of newly emerging topics 
          for after a decade, using the ProQuest dissertation database and Web of Science database data. Developed a 
          model incorporating a feature extraction system, feature engineering system, truth label engineering system,
          and a model training and prediction system. Currently able to predict with a precision at the top 200 for an around 50% accuracy.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Utilized Python as our development programming language. Managed the database using dask and pandas dataframe. 
          In this project, I worked extensively with machine learning packages such as seaborn, scikit-learn, PyTorch, and matplotlib,
          as well as data preprocessing packages like numpy and math. Gained valuable experience working with AWS virtual machines,
          managing teamwork effectively, and handling large-scale datasets. This project not only enhanced my technical skills in machine
          learning and data processing but also developed my abilities in collaborative teamwork and big data management.
